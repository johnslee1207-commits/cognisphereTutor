"""Turn-scoped chat-loop capabilities.

Each loop capability lives in its own subpackage under
:mod:`cognispheretutor.capabilities` (``solve``, ``mastery``). The chat loop imports
only the generic registry/protocol from this package; feature-specific prompts,
tools, and kwargs injection stay inside each capability subpackage.

A loop capability is "chat engine + decoupled capability logic": it reuses the
full chat tool surface and adds its own owned tools + a system prompt block on
top when active, instead of running a bespoke pipeline.
